# The Shnitzerator

This is my Phase-1 Javascript Prn school.
The Shnitzerator is a single page application to rate your favorite kinds of shnitzels. You can also submit your some of your own shnitzel ideas.




## Features

This app was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The data used is from a JSON server. As per project guidelines, there are three event listeners:

1. DOM Content Loaded
When the DOM content loads, a fetch request for data is sent.
As well, after the DOM content loads, the navbar events are attached.

2. Click
There are two click events on the navbar and one on the 

   A. Shnitzel: When the shnitzel tab on the navbar is clicked, all HTML from the main container is cleared and repopulated with image cards containing JSON data.

   B. Rating Stars: When a star is clicked, it and the stars to its left turn opaque to reflect a rating.

   C. Ideas: When the ideas tab on the navbar is clicked, all the HTML from the main container is cleared and repopulated by a form.

   

3. Submit
When the form on the ideas tab is submitted, the values from the form are appended on the page.
